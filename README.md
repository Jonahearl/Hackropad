I have tried to create a macropad which will allow me to do some fun things especially with what i'm hoping will work like arrow keys.

This is my first ever PCB and is actually quite sadly 102.2mm long which I am hoping won't matter cause I only saw that at the end...
I also just realised I don't actually know how to code in python so whatever I do probably won't even work haha

The specifications of this fine specimen include:

BOM
- 10x Cherry MX Switches
- 10x SK6812 MINI Leds
- 1x XIAO RP2040
- 10x Blank DSA Keycaps
- 4x M3x16 Bolt
- 4x M3 Heatset

Others:
- KMK Firmware
- Cover.step
- Base.step
